# About Me
I'm a third year Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University. 

Primarily interested in embedded systems and learning more about computer hardware / low level programming. 

My experiences include developing a High Voltage Safety Light PCB for Team Phantom Formula SAE, writing some C++ code for SFU Robot Soccer, and a Software Automation Test Co-op at Delta-Q where I developed internal testing tools in Python/NI Labview/NI TestStand.
